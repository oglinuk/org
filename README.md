# Association of Federated Knowledge Workers

An unofficial, official community for people who work with knowledge
(which is pretty much everyone at some point in their lives). We prefer
healthy irreverence to academic formality. We meet online for community
[live streams](https://rwxrob.live) Fridays at 9am American Eastern
time (-0500) also in `#afkwork` on Freenode.

## Governance

Right now we are just a bunch of people interested in promoting common
ways to work with knowledge and frankly haven't figured out what
governance will look like.

## Initiatives

* Knowledge Exchange Grid (KEG)
* Parsing Expression Grammar Notation (PEGN)

## Sayings

* "KEG, where knowledge brews" [\@Spationaute](https://twitch.tv/Spationaute)
* "Forbidden knowledge must be wrapped in a paper bag." [\@vmt](https://twitch.tv/vmt)
* "Package management for knowledge." 
* "KEG, knowledge exchange get." [\@Spationaute](https://twitch.tv/Spationaute) 
* "The only thing I need to remember is how to open my KEG" [\@rwxrob](https://twitch.tv/rwxrob)
* "KEGer, when knowledge workers meetup to exchange"

## Dedication

AFKWorks is dedicated to the life, work, and memory of Aaron Schwartz.
Watching [The Internet's Own
Boy](https://duck.com/lite?kd=-1&kp=-1&q=The+Internet's+Own+Boy) should
be mandatory before joining.

## Goals and Criteria

* Keep everything as simple as possible. No really, the only requirement
  to be an active knowledge contributor should be the ability to input
  text into a file.

* Best knowledge rises to the top based on what *you* trust, not what
  the mob upvotes and likes.

* Nothing preventing exchange of knowledge for money, just nothing
  specifically specified about how that happens.

* 100% transport agnostic. There is *nothing* specifying *how* the knowledge is
  exchanged over KEG, even USB sticks and sneaker-net is fine.
